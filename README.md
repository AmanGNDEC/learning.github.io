# My experience:-
### Day 1:-
My day started at **6:30 A.M**. I woke up in the morning and thanked God for the day, praying for an exciting day ahead. I come from Uttar Pradesh, which is why I am living in a hostel here. I reached the mess around **8:15 A.M**. and had my breakfast, though I was a little late. I arrived at Gurudwara Sahib around **9:10 A.M**. After that, I sat down fully relaxed and listened to kirtan.

After Ardas, we had a short tea break. Afterward, we all went to the college auditorium for our inaugural class. We waited there for a while before our class started with the inspiring words of **Harpreet Ma'am**. I felt the ***warmth of a mother*** in her words. Then our Principal motivated us to make the most of this platform and become very successful in our lives.

Then our NSET director told us about the illustrious history of this institution, how it has nurtured many brilliant minds that are making waves worldwide.Then our first guest of honour, the **PCS officer** in a very impressing way teaches us the lesson how to grab a opportunity.He took a 500 rupees note and asked if anyone wants that 500 rupees, I thought that time to take but i thought he is going to make me a example of greedy person but then one boy stood up and took that note then he told us that was an opportunity which that boy grabed. I learned from him that day is,**"Don't wait for opportunities; seize the opportunities that come to you"**.

Then our second guest of honor, **the ADGP officer**, shared many valuable stories about how God rewards our good deeds and punishes us for our bad deeds. He told us how God tests us in many phases of our lives. He spoke for about an hour and a half without any preparation, which is incredible. He could speak for the whole day effortlessly; his speaking skills are incredible.
In the end, I received countless lessons that will always help me in my life.

### Day 2:-
On this day, new opportunities arose for the students, thanks to **Dr. Arvind Dhingra**. He asked for eleven boys and eleven girls to come on stage for a game where the girls' and boys' teams had to compete against each other. The boys' team won the game. Afterward, he asked every participant to introduce themselves to all the students.

Then, **Dr. H.S. Rai**, the Controller of Examinations, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, seeing them as opportunities to shine.Unexpectedly, **Dr. H.S. Rai** asked for 10 students to work with him â€“ not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I was selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. Starting from the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely found elsewhere.

### Day 3:-
